Shows all unique themes from chunk coding\n2. Asks LLM to merge similar/overlapping ones\n3. Requests 3-5 final distinct themes\n4. Wants mapping: which original themes → which final theme\n\n**Temperature: 0.2 (low)**\n- Consolidation should be logical and consistent\n- Too high = creative but inconsistent groupings\n\n**How this differs from code condensation:**\n- **Code condensation:** Hierarchical grouping (initial → broader)\n- **Deduplication:** Horizontal merging (similar themes → single theme)\n\n**Alternative approaches:**\n- **Embedding similarity:** Use cosine similarity on theme embeddings to auto-cluster\n- **Manual review:** Export theme list and manually mark duplicates\n- **Hybrid:** LLM suggests merges, human approves\n\n**When to use:**\n- After coding 20+ chunks (enough variation to cause duplicates)\n- When you see obvious semantic overlap in theme names\n- Before final codebook creation\n\n**Expected output:** Clean, non-redundant final codebook with 3-5 themes, each with clear definition and list of merged original themes.",
