# GenAI for Sociology

Welcome to the computational companion for **SOC-GA 3000: Interdisciplinary Seminar on Generative AI in Sociology** at NYU.

## About This Course

This course introduces students to Generative AI (GenAI) technologies and their applications in sociological research. We focus on methods: what GenAI is, how it works, and how to use it for rigorous social science inquiry.

### Course Goals

- **Build foundational fluency** in Python and computational reasoning to implement GenAI models
- **Understand how LLMs work** and how they can be applied in sociological research
- **Critically assess** strengths, limitations, and ethical implications of generative AI in research contexts
- **Design, implement, and evaluate** LLM-driven sociological research projects

## Course Schedule

### **Week 1: Introduction to LLMs and Social Science**
What LLMs are and why they matter for sociological research; opportunities and pitfalls.

### **Week 2: Foundations: Embeddings and Representations**
How text is represented as vectors: static embeddings, geometric interpretation, and cultural meanings.

### **Week 3: Toward LLMs: Transformers and Contextual Models**
The transformer architecture, self-attention, and contextual embeddings; sociological applications.

### **Week 4: LLMs for Annotation I - Automated Content Analysis**
Using LLMs to annotate political text at scale; zero-shot and few-shot classification; measurement error.

### **Week 5: LLMs for Annotation II: Qualitative Coding and Thematic Analysis**
LLMs for qualitative coding: inductive and deductive thematic analysis, hybrid human-LLM workflows, and validation.

### **Week 6: LLMs for Annotation III: Prompt Engineering and Validation**
Advanced prompt-engineering strategies and robust validation for LLM-based annotation.

### **Week 7: LLMs for Synthetic Data I: Simulating Survey Respondents**
Using LLMs to simulate survey respondents; algorithmic fidelity and bias in synthetic samples ("silicon sampling").

### **Week 8: LLMs for Synthetic Data II - Behavioral Tests**
Interactive experiments: personalized persuasion, microtargeting, belief-change dialogues, and group dynamics.

### **Week 9: LLMs for Simulation I: Generative Agents**
Architectures for generative agents and scaling social simulations with LLMs.

### **Week 10: LLMs for Simulation II: Experiments**
Predicting experimental outcomes with LLMs; modeling human cognition; LLMs as experimental stand-ins.

### **Week 11: LLMs and Social Interaction**
Why socially aware LLMs require rich interaction datasets; bridging interactionist sociology and AI.

## About the Notebooks

Each computational notebook in this book includes:
- **Clear learning objectives** for the session
- **Setup instructions** for Google Colab and local environments
- **Working code examples** demonstrating core techniques
- **Exercises** to reinforce concepts
- **Further readings** and resources

## How to Use This Book

### Running in Google Colab (Recommended)
1. Click the ðŸš€ rocket icon at the top of any notebook page
2. Select "Colab" to open in Google Colab
3. Run cells sequentially (Shift+Enter)
4. Install packages as prompted

### Running Locally
1. Clone or download the repository
2. Install Python 3.8+ and dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Launch Jupyter: `jupyter notebook`
4. Open the desired `.ipynb` file

## Prerequisites

- **Basic Python programming**: variables, functions, loops, conditionals
- **Familiarity with NumPy and pandas** for data manipulation
- **Basic ML concepts**: training/testing, classification, evaluation
- **(Optional) OpenAI API key** for Weeks 4-6 (required for some exercises). I will also share temporary API keys in class so don't worry about this.

## AI Use Statement

This course is about generative AIâ€”so AI use is not just permitted, it's expected. But ask yourself: am I using this as a **tool** to augment my learning, or as a **substitute** for thinking?

Language models are powerful technologies that can enhance research at unprecedented scale and pace. They can also be a crutch that prevents you from developing the fluency and deep understanding required to excel in this field.

**The question is**: Are you building the intellectual muscles needed to operate in this world, or are you outsourcing the hard work?

Assignments in this course are primarily lab-based and collaborative. You'll work through notebooks together, check each other's code, and explain your implementations. Don't outsource your learningâ€“â€“you'll only shortchange yourself.
