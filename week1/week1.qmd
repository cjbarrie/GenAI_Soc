## Course Overview
- goals, schedule, grading

## Discussion

::: incremental
- introductions
- how do you use AI (LLMs)?
- what are your interests?
- is it stopping your from learning?
- do you ever stop to question yourself?
- how does it feel to be a grad. student in this moment?

## AI "Policy"
- Here's my thoughts...

## AI is booming

## Where do we place all of this stuff??

Situating the field

::: incremental
- Text as data
- Machine learning
- Algorithmic bias
- Simulation
:::

## Text as data

::: incremental
- Using text as a source of data for social science research
- Coding according to rules and textual features

## So how do LLMs bring any of this together

- LLMs both tool and object of inquiry (similar to ML)
- LLMs can do (all? most?) of the above tasks

## What am I talking about?

## LLMs come from text as data

:::incremental
  - trained on massive corpora of text
  - learn patterns in text
  - generate text
  - can follow codebooks
:::

## LLMs are also machine learning

:::incremental
  - trained using machine learning techniques
  - can be fine-tuned for specific tasks
  - can be used as components in larger ML systems
:::

## LLMs can also be used in simulations

:::incremental
  - agents can be powered by LLMs
  - can simulate human-like behavior
  - can generate realistic scenarios
:::

## LLMs can be objects of study

:::incremental
  - how do they reflect biases in training data?
  - how do they impact society?
  - what are the ethical implications?
:::

## This creates massive opportunities

:::incremental
- We can annotate text at scale
- We can build complex models of social phenomena
- We can simulate complex social systems
- We can study the impact of AI on society
:::

## But also massive challenges

:::incremental
- Ethical considerations
- Bias and fairness
- Interpretability
- Reproducibility
